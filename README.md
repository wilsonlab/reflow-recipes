### reflow-recipes
Some arduino code for running different temperature profiles using the toaster-based reflow oven in the workshop

#### Usage
Just upload the sketch that best fits your reflow requirements (e.g. leaded or lead-free solder, tiny or large board) to the arduino on top of the reflow toaster and then run it by pressing button '1'. Don't put food in the oven with your PC Board.
